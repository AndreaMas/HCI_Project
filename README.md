Human computer interaction videogame project, made by **Andrea Masciulli** and **Alessandro Pegoraro**. 

## Project structure

The project consists of a python script and a unity project:

- the python script is responsible to detect the player's hands in front of the camera. The hand position is then sent on a port through UTP protocol.
- the unity project lissens on the aforementioned port (with a custom script) and accordingly exploits the hand position for its gameplay.

**NOTE**: The repo misses the aforementioned python script. This is because we suggest following the initial 20 minutes of [Murtaza's Workshop Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ-2JWzNc6k) to setup the python virtual environment. After that setup, the unity project should work fine.
